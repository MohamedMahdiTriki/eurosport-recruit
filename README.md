This is a simple project to display some (fake) informations about tennis players using React, GraphQL, Redux Toolkit and Typescript

Tailwind is used as CSS Framework wheras Jest is the one for unit tests.

To launch the graphql server:

 cd .\graphql-server-example\
 npm install
 npm start

 The server will work on port 4000

 On a different CLI, to launch the Frontend app:

cd .\eurosport_recruit\
npm install
npm run dev


To run tests: 
cd .\eurosport_recruit\
npm run test

At the moment, there is an error while testing in PageContent.tsx in line 28
I am actually working on it

The app will start on port 5173
