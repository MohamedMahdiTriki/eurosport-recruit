This is a simple project to display some (fake) informations about tennis players using React, GraphQL, Redux Toolkit and Typescript

Tailwind is used as CSS Framework wheras Jest is the one for unit tests.

To launch the graphql server:

 cd .\graphql-server-example\
 npm install
 npm start

 The server will work on port 4000

 On a different CLI, to launch the Frontend app:

cd .\eurosport_recruit\
npm install
npm run dev


To run tests: 
cd .\eurosport_recruit\
npm run test

I left my tests commented because there are errors when excuting them and to see the logic that
I tried to bring in my unit tests. I tried to mock my request and test another static component.
It will be an improvement to fix these tests.
I left dummy tests that work instead.

The app will start on port 5173
